"""Tests that saving an edited source file cannot destroy the previous content (issue #1958).

``CodeEditor._save_edited_file`` is the third of the three direct ``open(path, "w")`` writes the
issue lists; the two in ``MemoryManager`` were addressed in #1969, which is also where
``write_file_atomic`` comes from.

The editor is exercised through a stub subclass so that the inherited save path can be driven
without a language server.
