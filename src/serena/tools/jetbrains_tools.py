        Finds symbols and code entities (classes, methods, etc.) based on the given name path pattern.
        The returned symbol information can be used for edits or further queries.
        Specify `depth > 0` to retrieve children (e.g., methods of a class).
        Important: through `search_deps=True` dependencies can be searched, which
        should be preferred to web search or other less sophisticated approaches to analyzing dependencies.
        You will always receive at least quick info for returned symbols (even if `include_info=False`).

        A name path is a path in the symbol tree *within a source file*.
        For example, the method `my_method` defined in class `MyClass` would have the name path `MyClass/my_method`.
        If a symbol is overloaded (e.g., in Java), a 0-based index is appended (e.g. "MyClass/my_method[0]") to
        uniquely identify it.

        To search for a symbol, you provide a name path pattern that is used to match against name paths.
        It can be
         * a simple name (e.g. "method"), which will match any symbol with that name
         * a relative path like "class/method", which will match any symbol with that name path suffix
         * an absolute name path "/class/method" (absolute name path), which requires an exact match of the full name path within the source file.
        Append an index `[i]` to match a specific overload only, e.g. "MyClass/my_method[1]".
        In any path component, using `*` will match any sequence of characters (excluding /), e.g. "Class/*substring*" matches a member substring.
        A pattern must not contain only wildcards (e.g. "*" or "/*").

        :param name_path_pattern: the name path matching pattern (see above)
        :param depth: depth up to which descendants shall be retrieved (e.g. use 1 to also retrieve immediate children;
            for the case where the symbol is a class, this will return its methods).
            Ignored if `include_body=True`. Default 0.
        :param relative_path: Optional. Restrict search to this file or directory. If not specified, searches entire codebase.
            Note: for external dependencies, this must be an identifier starting with `<ext` that you have received
            earlier (don't try to guess!).
        :param include_body: If True, include the symbol's full source code.
        :param include_info: whether to include additional info (hover-like, typically including docstring and signature),
            about the symbol.
            Default False; info is never included for child symbols or if include_body is True.
        :param search_deps: If True, also search in project dependencies (e.g., libraries).
        :param max_matches: Maximum number of permitted matches. If exceeded, a shortened result is returned
