        VERY IMPORTANT: The "regex" mode allows very large sections of code to be replaced WITHOUT

        wildcards instead of pasting the exact original text — shorter, cheaper, and you cannot make
        mistakes, because an ambiguous match returns an error you can refine, so wildcards are safe.

        Replaces occurrences of a pattern across multiple files in ONE call.

        This is the preferred tool for repeated small edits (renames, import swaps, annotation changes,
        path prefixes) spanning several files or many places in one file: one call with a SHORT pattern
        replaces many single-file replacements with long disambiguating needles.

        Recommended protocol whenever there is ANY risk of unintended replacements:
        1. Call with dry_run=True: every prospective change is returned as a minimal line diff with an
           occurrence id; nothing is modified.
        2. Call again with dry_run=False, passing the ids you want in occurrence_ids (omit it to apply
           all). You pick the desired replacements from the list - no counting, no needle-crafting.

        For clearly unambiguous bulk replacements you may skip the dry run; pass expected_count as a
        guard. If the actual number of matches differs, NOTHING is changed and the diff list is
        returned, so a failed guard costs one call and gives you the dry-run output to select from.

            syntax with DOTALL and MULTILINE) to search for

            replacement is restricted; if any id is unknown or stale, NOTHING is changed. If omitted,
            all occurrences are replaced.
        :param expected_count: optional guard for calls without occurrence_ids: the number of
            occurrences you expect to be replaced. If the actual count differs, nothing is changed and
            the list of prospective changes is returned. -1 disables the guard.
